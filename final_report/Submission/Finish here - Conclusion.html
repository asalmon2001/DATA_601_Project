<h1>Conclusion<a rel="noopener" class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusion">&#182;</a></h1><p>In conclusion, through the project we were able to determine that there are relationships between Building Permits and Economic Factors in Calgary (The City of Calgary, 2023). Residential Permit types are the most common permit type between 2000-2023. Improvements on existing buildings is the most frequent work class but New permits do increase in frequency during times of economic recovery like during 2021, post-COVID. During a period of economic downturn, the construction industry slows and building permits begin to decline in frequency as seen during the 2008 recession. The data analysis showed an inverse relationship between unemployment rate and building permit values. As one decreases, the other increases but does vary in strength across industries. City planning does play a role in the behaviour of building permits and building permit values. When new large installations or communities are planned, the non-residential building permits rise initially, followed by residential permits to build up the area around it. Shown in the case of the South Health Campus and Seton. Urban planning also comes into play when looking at the trends in the different sections of the city. Central communities see more improvement work class groups, while communities on the outer parts of Calgary (usually newer developments) see more new builds.</p>
<p>Our investigations on the relationship between building permits, building permit values and the economic factors explored show that construction in the city (shown by building permit number and total value) can be an indicator of the economic health of the city.</p>
